Effective communication and data sharing are the backbones of any organizationâ€™s success.
With the rapid digitization of business processes, organizations are increasingly dependent
on advanced networking solutions to stay competitive. Pakistan Telecom operates from two
separate facilities in Gulshan, Karachi: an office block housing Sales and Marketing
departments and a warehouse hosting Equipment and Services departments. Currently, the
lack of a robust network infrastructure between these facilities creates inefficiencies,
including delays in communication, manual data transfer, and limited access to shared
resources.
This project proposes the deployment of a high-speed Ethernet network to interconnect
these facilities. The network will integrate departmental workstations and printers, enabling
employees to collaborate efficiently and access resources in real time. The proposed
solution also addresses the challenge of the 500-meter distance between the office and
warehouse by incorporating structured cabling solutions with boosters for seamless
connectivity. In addition to addressing current operational challenges, the network will be
designed to accommodate future expansion, ensuring it remains a valuable asset for years
to come. The successful implementation of this project will transform the way Pakistan
Telecom operates, enhancing productivity, streamlining workflows, and improving overall
organizational efficiency.
